Notifies you when a new release has been made on repositories you starred on Github.

### Features

Emails you when a new release has been made on Github.

### Why

I wanted to create an app fully functioning with the latest javascript (es6, linting, coverage ...) and to learn how to build a real app from scratch with a graphql back and frontend.

### Stack

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react)
- [Apollo](http://www.apollostack.com)
- [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
